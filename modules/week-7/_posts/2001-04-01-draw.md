# drawing the particles

Now that we have discussed the const identifier, let's look at the rest of the program.  The setup, creates the canvas.  We have seen this many times before.

However, let's breakdown the draw.

```js

const particles = [];

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    let p = new Particle();
    particles.push(p);
  }
  for (let i = particles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    particles[i].update();
    particles[i].show();
    if (particles[i].finished()) {
      // remove this particle
      particles.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
}
```

#### push

The first section to look at is the initial for loop.

```js
 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    let p = new Particle();
    particles.push(p);
  }
```

In this for loop, a new particle is created and then pushed onto the particles array.  You see that the `p` variable is assigned a Particle object which is created when the `new` keyword is invoked and the `Particle()` constructor is called.

<!-- T/F is the constructor a function?  How do we know if it is or not?-->

Then, the new object reference `p` is pushed onto the array.

#### display

```js
for (let i = particles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    particles[i].update();
    particles[i].show();
    if (particles[i].finished()) {
      // remove this particle
      particles.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
```
In this next section, it iterates over the particles array and then calls the `update` function and then the `show` function.  It continually checks to see if the particle is dead by using the `finished` function and if it is dead, it is removed from the array.  **Note** When an object is removed from an array in p5.js, the array is readjusted so that there are no gaps in the array.  

_Question_ Why are we going from the end of the array to the beginning?  Does it matter?  Try it out!
