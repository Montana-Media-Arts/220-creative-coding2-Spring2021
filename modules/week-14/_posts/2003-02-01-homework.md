# Homework

This week is all about creating something new and interesting from using createImage and saveImages (maybe even an NFT).  I want you to create at least one sketch using createImage and another sketch that generates the images for movie usage using saveFrames.

1. Create one sketch using createImage. You can decide how you want to work with the pixels to generate a piece of art.
2. Create a second sketch that uses some p5 experience to generate frames.
3. Take the images stored and put them in your assets folder.  Using what you know from earlier in the semester, read in the names of those files from a text file, put the names in the different frames.
4. Create a program that iterates over the different frames to create a "movie". Don't forget to check the frameRate.
5. Upload all your files to GitHumb and submit your link in Moodle.
